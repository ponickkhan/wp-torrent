README wp-torrent

wp-torrent is a wordpress application which transforms wordpress into a torrent tracker using XBTT as a backend.
(http://xbtt.sourceforge.net/tracker/)

To change the theme of the site please create a child theme according to
http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes. An example is included in child-theme-example

-----

The reason for this tomfoolery is to learn more about Wordpress and at the same time XBTT. For various reasons
I've been looking at different trackers and I feel no one fits todays web, that's why I've decided to go with
Wordpress as a base. 

Wordpress is easy to develop to which makes developing child plugins easy as a pie (I hope).
